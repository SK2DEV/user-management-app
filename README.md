This is a mini task submission for Mallow Technologies' React Developer interview process. The application allows user login, and basic user data management with add, edit, and delete functionality.

## 🚀 Features
- Login functionality with fake API handling
- Add / Edit / Delete users
- Responsive layout with clean UI
- Form validation and error handling

## 🔐 Authentication Logic

- This project uses a fake API (`https://reqres.in`) for login.
- Since the API returns a token for **any** password, I implemented a custom password check in the frontend.
- The correct credentials are:
 "email": "eve.holt@reqres.in",
 "password": "cityslicka"
